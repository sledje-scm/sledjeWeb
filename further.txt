update stock in inverory upon compltion of order
each days transaction be shared via gmail and also monthly gmail edit
add a expiry field as wellS

the quantity in shelf should fetch value from orders so as for the retailer to know that the item is already ordered
constraints
if order on way has left the warehouse .. it need to be handled separately

for fetching data in orders page:

order in payments section should have a bundles red stamp ...just to give feel
cards of oders in shelf should have a ordered stamp to give feel


const [data, setData] = useState([]); // Initialize state as an empty array

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('your-api-endpoint') // Replace with your actual API endpoint
    .then(response => response.json()) // Parse the response as JSON
    .then(data => {
      setData(data); // Update the state with the parsed JSON data
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    });
}, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this effect runs only once on mount



the inventory should have column for ordered items

design inventory management system and ordering system for this if i already have an authentication system

Remember, there should be  a product catalog from where all products of all distributors can be accessed which will be displayed only when searched

there should be an inventory of items which is added from the product catalog if ordered even once


add a list by distributor and a list by category filter
