1. In shop designed by gujan it mentioned Shop A and Shop B 
   hence assuming the shop will be used and logged in in two
   use cases Retailer and Distributor to either track customer orders
   in a terminal or retailers' order in respect to Distributor.
2. There is * upcoming * orders section in shop dashboard and a separate tab 
   is for any problem related to orders tracking. Possible suggestion 
   is making the dashboard only to create order and a link to view all 
   orders provided to send user directly to orders page where he can view all
   pending orders. And lets say order is placed so there should be a option to pay now
   and then payment window should come. and a option to track orders should be there too.
   the shop dashboard should be a landing hub for registered business just like for advertisement
   the landing home page is.
   Possibly a low stock warning can be there to direct to shelf from shop dashboard.
   Control flow suggested by Nishant.
